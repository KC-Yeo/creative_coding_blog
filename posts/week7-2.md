## Sianne Ngai: Zany, Cute, Interesting, McKenzie Wark
  For my assignment 2, I think zany is the system feeding into the zaniness. It's like the reaction of being at the esge of limits is the whole point of zany. Working beyond the limits/contraints. My idea going into assignment 2 with Merlin Sheldrake's passage as my response is similar to this that it's talking about fungus that quite literally has no constraints to them. They show up whenever and whereever, growing and growing. 

## AT2
 Variables: Using variables to store values from the start. This is to setup some functions.
 Functions: To use functions for interactivity.
 Iteration: Using loop functions is the main component of the sketch, to repeat and redraw
 Boolean: Using boolean to setup audio if they are playing while the page is running ot to stop with a mouse click.
 Arrays: To store different particles that are in the sketch.
 Classes: To define the look and colour of the particles and have them be different each time.

In response to the text "What_is_it_like_to_be_a_fungus by Merline Sheldrake, I decided to use a Perlin noise effect from p5.js to mimick the roots of mycelium. Using the visual of growth to show the interconnectivity of the "wood wide web".

I would say it's pretty post-digital considering it uses digital and mimicks the organic ways of life like fungi.
