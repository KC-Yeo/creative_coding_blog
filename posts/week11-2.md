1. [My Community](#C)

**##Communities of Practice**
Domain:
  My domain is my siblings that lives long distance. I have 3 brothers in Malaysia and 1 in the US. I had them draw their own inspiration of houses in their aesthetic but with three states of the house: "in", "out", and "waiting". Some took more time as they were busy with work and school, and I also had them record themsleves drawing the houses.
<br>
Repertoire:
  We call almost everyday if possible but like I sawd before, my siblings have busy lives. We update on our lives everytime we call and we also bring our problems to be discussed. Just so we don't face the world alone. Hence, I want to make somehting that respects each others' privacy but also have time for family.
