## drafts
1. I wanted to use three.js library to create a 3d environment where users can react to the scene. My initial idea on this was to have a globe of spores interconencting each other and have the connections change each time the user clicks on the canvas. And creating an audio that becomes more glitchy as it moves to the right. But due to my limites skills and time management, I couldn't complete my assignment in time if I were to use that idea.

[spores](http://localhost/AT2_1.html)??

2. Then after researching my ideas, and the response I came across the effect of Perlin noise on Youtube courtesy of The Coding Train channel. I reallly liked the randomness and patterns that it produces and I think it encapsulates the idea of mycelium quite nicely. Here is my draft of perlin noise using p5 online editor.

<iframe id = "perlin" src="https://editor.p5js.org/KC-Yeo/full/osRFU1TQX"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`perlin`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

## Three passages from "What_is_it_like_to_be_a_fungus by Merlin Sheldrake
  *"Spores are carried upward by a current of wind generated by mushrooms as water evaporates form their gills."*
  
  *"Plants and mycorrhizal fundi are promiscuous: many funig can live within the roots of a single plant, and many pkants can connect with a signle fungal network. In this way a variety of substances, from nutrients to signlaing compounds, can pass between plants via fungal connections. In simple terms, plants are socially networked by fungi. This is what is meant by the "wood wide web"."*
  
  *"Physarum form explanatory networks made of tentacle-like veins and have no central nervous system - nor anything that resembles one. yet they can "make decisions" by comparing a range of possible courses of action and can find the shortest path between two points in a labyrinth."*

## feedbacks
Some feedbacks from friends:
* I spoke to Khai and Minami with my drafts. I showed them 2 versions of my ideas and Khai mentioned that she prefers the spores one. She suggested to have the spores and lines change the positions and line connections every time mouse clicks, enhancing the chaos. As for the audio, she suggested to have it connected with the globe of spores, everytime the user spins the globe the audio changes it's frequency and amplitude.
