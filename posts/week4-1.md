Please use either Canvas API or the p5 online editor to create three example compositions, demonstrating:
high compressibility
low compressibility
high effective complexity

In his paper, What is Generative Art: Complexity Theory as a Context for Art TheoryLinks to an external site. (2003), Philip Galanter writes that " ... some maintain that this notion of structure is subjective and remains in the eye of the beholder. "  Why might this be useful for the purposes of making generative art?  
Embed and refer to the three examples created above to support your explanation.
In your third example, what concepts and code are responsible for creating structure, in this sense?
Choose an art work from one of these artists. 
Discuss how this artist has used structure and randomness to achieve effective complexity in their work.
