## Domain, Repertoire, Plan
  Domain: My long distance siblings that are never in the same country since we've decided to study and live abroad. We have always been close and regularly update each other calls and messages. 

  Repertoire:
  But precisely because of this that we sometimes disturb each other's working time. We call each other at the wrong time and usually in a different timezone. Unless there's an emergency. 

  Plan: 
  My plan is to have us draw our own houses the represents our 'home'. In a specific colour, we get to represent if we're at home or in need of a talk. So then we won't distrub each other with unexpected calls and messages at midnight. 
  <br>
  I also hope to have my community interact with the houses in real-time. So if the status of the house changes, we can see it from across the world. I'm not too sure how to go about it. I have to ask Tom about it.
