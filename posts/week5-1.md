I picked the one I suggested in class because I think his work is kind of like a example of merging 2 mediums into one. His work is usually wooden that is carved into something with a glitch effect, which only happens in the digital world. Is he a post-digital artist? I think so. In Floriam Cramer's "What is 'Post-digital'", they mentioned that 'post' must not ber understood as the past but what is beyond. In this case, I would think the artist has deliberately merged 2 mediums, digital and physical, to make art. I think this would be beyond the scope of post-digital.

If he were using javascript, I would think he is well acquainted with glitch effects. Seeing as his artwork is indeed mimicking the glitch.

<!-- <script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>

<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
    const cnv = document.getElementById ("p5_example")

    function setup () {
        const w = cnv.parentNode.scrollWidth
        const h = w * 9 / 16
        createCanvas (w, h, P2D, cnv)
        
    }

    function draw () {
        background (`turquoise`)
        console.log (frameCount)
    }
</script> -->
