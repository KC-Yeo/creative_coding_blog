## Why Was He Sad by Rafael Rozendaal [^1]

[^1]: [Why Was He Sad](https://www.whywashesad.com/)

## Visually
For the visual aspect in this work of Rafael Rozendaal, I think it captures the innocent and child-like manner of a cartoon. It has simple designs with existing objects, the sky and clouds. Although the colour pallete in this sketch is simple, I think it helps users to interact with the sketch effectively. The inspiration of having radial gradient is from the work of Rafael Rozendaal's [Center](https://www.newrafael.com/center/) & [Radial](https://www.newrafael.com/radial/).

## Sonically
I wasn't sure if there was any audio from this sketch when I clicked the mouse, but when I moves it around the sketch it creates a cartoonish sound. It almost sounds like bubbles popping or like something slipping like a cartoon character when the clouds disntegrates. It sounds very innocent and playful, something that invites youthful-ness to play with it. The inspiration for my sound would be Rafael Rozendaal's [Why Was He Sad](https://www.whywashesad.com/).

## Interactively
The clouds disappear when the mouse hovers over it. It makes extra space for more clouds to load on the sketch, like the popping a bubble.

## Feedbacks
Lam:
"I think you've done a lovely job with the interactions, the colours and the sounds. I can see the circles moving with the mouse, which is nice. Then I think the one thing that needs to be improved is maybe a different colour for the background, instead of pure white it would be better and less monotonous. And the circle design could be a bit bigger, because it might be a bit less obvious."

Mataseo:
"WOW!! yours is so cool! great job ü§©üëè I think you've definitely achieved the cute aesthetic register with the visuals, sound, and interaction.  There's not much I can fault, maybe having a slight variation in the spawn size of the circles could be cuter? ü§∑ I also noticed if you click the circles while they grow or the ones floating around sometimes they'll just change colour, but I'm not sure if that was deliberate. Otherwise, I really like how simple it is and how fun it is to play."

Joelle:
"It looks really cute and neat. The delayed mouse chasing is also a nice touch to your sketch, you know what would be even more interesting? Have a set of eyes that blinks. I think it would bring the cuteness out."
