# [Why Was He Sad](https://www.whywashesad.com/) by Rafael Rozendaal

## Visually
For the visual aspect in this work of Rafael Rozendaal, I think it captures the innocent and child-like manner of a cartoon. It has simple designs with existing objects, the sky and clouds. Although the colour pallete in this sketch is simple, I think it helps users to interact with the sketch effectively. 

## Sonically
I wasn't sure if there was any audio from this sketch when I clicked the mouse, but when I moves it around the sketch it creates a cartoonish sound. It almost sounds like bubbles popping or like something slipping like a cartoon character when the clouds disntegrates. It sounds very innocent and playful, something that invites youthful-ness to play with it.

## Interactively
The clouds disappear when the mouse hovers over it. It makes extra space for more clouds to load on the sketch, like popping a bubble.
