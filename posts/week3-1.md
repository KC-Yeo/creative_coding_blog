# [Why Was He Sad](https://www.whywashesad.com/) by Rafael Rozendaal

## Visually
For the visual aspect in this work of Rafael Rozendaal, I think it captures the innocent and child-like manner of a cartoon. It has simple designs with existing objects, the sky and clouds. Although the colour pallete in this sketch is simple, I think it helps users to interact with the sketch effectively. 

## Sonically
I wasn't sure if there was any audio from this sketch when I clicked the mouse, but when I moves it around the sketch it creates a cartoonish sound. It almost sounds like bubbles popping or like something slipping like a cartoon character when the clouds disntegrates. It sounds very innocent and playful, something that invites youthful-ness to play with it.

## Interactively
The clouds disappear when the mouse hovers over it. It makes extra space for more clouds to load on the sketch, like the popping a bubble.

# Feedbacks
Lam:
I think you've done a lovely job with the interactions, the colours and the sounds. I can see the circles moving with the mouse, which is nice. Then I think the one thing that needs to be improved is maybe a different colour for the background, instead of pure white it would be better and less monotonous. And the circle design could be a bit bigger, because it might be a bit less obvious.

With regard to your AT1, and using embedded p5 sketches, explain how you plan on achieving the aesthetic register of cute:
visually
sonically
interactively
Enlist some feedback on your ideas from a colleague.  Ask them, for each of your examples above:
how well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?
what could you try to increase the cuteness?
how might you use implement these improvements using javascript?
